# Rusty NeetCode

This is a collection of LeetCode problems that I have attempted to solve during my
ongoing journey to proficiency in DSA and Rust.
I wanted to improve on DSA and Rust at the same time, hence this repo where I "log"
my submissions in the hope to also help some other fellow *Rustacean* trying to grasp
with the two.

Below you can find a list of problems that have been currently solved.

The list is heavily influenced by the roadmap from [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/roadmap),
which I have been following to improve my skills. Most exercises are
likely to present multiple solutions, my personal attempt and the solution
provided by NeetCode.
